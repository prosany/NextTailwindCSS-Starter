## Next.js TailwindCSS Starter

You can clone and use the template.

## Getting Started

Before doing anything, make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your machine. Node.js v18 or later is required.

### Clone the application

To clone the template from GitHub, open any terminal and run this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/prosany/NextTailwindCSS-Starter.git
```

### Setup the environment

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update the fields:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=
NEXT_FILE_UPLOAD_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=
```

### Install app dependencies

To install all the packages, simply run:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# using yarn
yarn install

# using pnpm
pnpm install
```

Great news! I guess you have successfully installed all the app dependencies.
